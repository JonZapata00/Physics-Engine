NOTE: I encourage to make a Release build.

This is a fully fledge 3D Physics Engine that works with any shape, as long as it is convex.

----- Features -----
- Rigidbody dynamics, including linear and rotational dynamics.
- Collision detection using the Separating Axis Theorem.
- Collision resolution using an iterative solver.

----- Controls -----
- Press "Create Rigidbody" or c to create an object.
- Use right click + mouse movement to look around.
- Use right click + WASD to move forward/backward, right/left.
- When clicking on an object, a GUI window will pop up. You have selected an object, and you can:
	- Use the gizmo to change its transform (you can also use the GUI).
	- Modify its rigidbody properties. This includes mass, inertia tensor, friction coefficient...
		- NOTE: Setting an object's mass to 0 will make it fully static!! i.e. it will 
		  never move unless you use the gizmo or change this value.
	- You can select whether an object is affected by forces, gravity... Using the GUI

- The rightmost GUI panel controls the overall Physics Engine. You can change:
	- the delta time used for integration.
	- the restitution coefficient used to solve collisions.
	- There is an option to select a scene. There are a total of 5 scenes that I created, each 
	with different objects and interactions. Feel free to play around with them.
		- NOTE: for the chaos demo, I recommend spamming the "c" button (up to a point
		or it will start lagging)
		- You can create your own scenes as well. Simply type your scene name in the text
		box and click save scene. Note that it will also save the camera's current position.
